        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>

        </p>

            I developed a fully functional e-commerce website using Django, Bootstrap, and Stripe for payment processing. The website features a user-friendly interface, secure authentication, and real-time inventory management.
        </p>
        <h4>Outcome</h4>

            The business saw a 40% increase in sales within the first three months of launching the website.

        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
            A client needed a way to visualize and analyze large datasets to make data-driven decisions.
        </p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            I built an interactive dashboard using Python, Plotly, and Dash. The dashboard allows users to filter data, generate charts, and export reports.
        </p>
        <h4>Outcome</h4>
        <p>
            The client reported a 50% reduction in time spent analyzing data and improved decision-making accuracy.

        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
            A team needed a centralized platform to manage tasks, track progress, and collaborate effectively.
        </p>
        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
            I created a task management app using Django and React. The app includes features like task assignment, due date tracking, and real-time notifications.
        </p>
        <h4>Outcome</h4>
        <p>
            The teamâ€™s productivity increased by 30%, and project completion rates improved significantly.
